	\brief Sweep a specified geometry object in space and test for collision with a set of given triangles.

	\note Only the following geometry types are supported: PxSphereGeometry, PxCapsuleGeometry, PxBoxGeometry
	\note If a shape from the scene is already overlapping with the query shape in its starting position, behavior is controlled by the PxSceneQueryFlag::eINITIAL_OVERLAP flag.

	\param[in] unitDir Normalized direction of the sweep.
	\param[in] distance Sweep distance. Needs to be larger than 0.
	\param[in] geom The geometry object to sweep. Supported geometries are #PxSphereGeometry, #PxCapsuleGeometry and #PxBoxGeometry
	\param[in] pose Pose of the geometry object to sweep.
	\param[in] triangleCount Number of specified triangles
	\param[in] triangles Array of triangles to sweep against
	\param[out] sweepHit The sweep hit information. On hit, both faceID parameters will hold the index of the hit triangle. Only valid if this method returns true.
	\param[in] hintFlags Specification of the kind of information to retrieve on hit. Combination of #PxSceneQueryFlag flags
	\param[in] cachedIndex Cached triangle index for subsequent calls. Cached triangle is tested first. Optional parameter.
	\return True if the swept geometry object hits the specified triangles
