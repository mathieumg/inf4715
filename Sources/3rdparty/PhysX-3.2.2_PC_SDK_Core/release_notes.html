		<li>Fixed a bug where the character controller could rise off the ground when hitting another character controller.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where releasing a shape of a touching actor and then releasing the character controller would crash. Releasing shapes of actors in touch may still lead to crashes in other situations. PxController::invalidateCache() can be used to work around these situations.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4> CCD </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed culling bug in CCD sweeps with meshes with transforms that caused contacts to be missed </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The vehicle sdk used to make the assumption that wheels 0 and 1 (the front wheels) of a PxVehicleDrive4W responded positively to the input steering wheel angle, while wheels 2 and 3 (the rear wheels) responded in the opposite direction to that of the input steering wheel angle.  A consequence of this assumed behaviour was the restriction that PxVehicleWheelData::mMaxSteer was limited to positive values.  This restriction has now been relaxed with the caveat that PxVehicleWheelData::mMaxSteer must be in range (-Pi/2, Pi/2).  It is now possible to turn each wheel positively or negatively relative to the input steering wheel angle by choosing positive or negative values for PxVehicleWheelData::mMaxSteer.  Ackermann steer correction might result in the front and rear wheels competing against each other if the rear and front all steer in the same direction relative to the input steering wheel angle. If this is the case it will be necessary to set the Ackermann accuracy to zero.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to set the engine rotation speed (PxVehicleDriveDynData::setEngineRotationSpeed), the rotation speed of each wheel (PxVehicleWheelsDynData::setWheelRotationSpeed) and the rotation angle of each wheel (PxVehicleWheelsDynData::setWheelRotationAngle). The default values for each of these properties remains zero.</li>
		<li>Wheel contact reporting has been improved with the addition of a number of query functions to the PxVehicleWheelsDynData class.  These are getTireDrivableSurfaceContactPoint, getTireDrivableSurfaceContactNormal, getTireLongitudinalDir, getTireLateralDir, getSuspensionForce, getTireDrivableSurfaceShape.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to store a userData pointer per wheel.  This allows, for example, each wheel to be associated with a game object.  The relevant functions are PxVehicleWheelsDynData::setUserData and PxVehicleWheelsDynData::getUserData.</li>
		<li>The default behavior of PxVehicleWheels::setWheelShapeMapping has changed. Previously, default values were automatically assigned to each wheel at construction so that the ith wheel was mapped to the ith body shape.  This, however, made the assumption that there was a wheel shape for each wheel, which is not always true.  As a consequence, the default value is now -1, meaning any mapping between body shape and wheel has to be explictily made by calling setWheelShapeMapping.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to query the mapping between wheel and body shape with PxVehicleWheels::getWheelShapeMapping.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to query the tire shader data that has been applied to each wheel with PxVehicleWheelsDynData::getTireForceShaderData.</li>
		<li>The helper function PxVehicleComputeSprungMasses has been added to aid the setup of the suspension sprung masses from the rigid body centre of mass and wheel center coordinates.</li>
		<li>The scene query filter data applied to the suspension raycasts was previously taken from the filter data of the associated body shape.  This makes the assumption of a body shape per wheel, which is not always true.  As a consequence, the filter data must be explictly set per wheel by calling PxVehicleWheels::setSceneQueryFilterData.  The filter data can be queried with PxVehicleWheels::getSceneQueryFilterData.</li>
		<li>Sub-stepping of the vehicle update can now be applied per vehicle with PxVehicleWheelsSimData::setSubStepCount.</li>
		<li>PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceToTireFrictionPairs has been modified so that the dictionary of material pointers can be updated without the necessity of further allocation.  The create function has been replaced with separate allocate and setup functions.</li>
		<li>A new vehicle type PxVehicleNoDrive has been added to provide a close approximation to backwards compatibility with the api of the 2.8.x NxWheelShape.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Visual Remote Debugger</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added PVD compatible profile zones for batched queries.</li>
		<li>Added the ability to capture and inspect scene queries in PVD.</li>
		<li>SDK will now flush the pvd connection stream immediately after cloth or cloth fabric is created or released.</li>
        <li>Fixed the PVD support for articulations.</li>
        <li>Fixed PVD rendering wrong constraint limits.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Documentation</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrong statement in PxRigidStatic::release() has been corrected. Static rigid bodies do wake up touching dynamic rigid bodies on release.</li>
		<li>Wrong statement in PxShape::setFlag() has been corrected. It is a valid operation to clear all flags.</li>
		<li>Retroactively added more detail about changes to 3.2.1 release notes below.</li>
	</ul>

<a name="knownissues322">Known Issues And Limitations</a></h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Memory leaks might get reported when using the debug versions of malloc and free together with the debug version of PhysX on Microsoft Windows platforms with Visual Studio 2010. This is caused by a bug in the Visual Studio 2010 runtime libraries. If such a leak appears immediately after releasing PhysX and all its components, please contact us for information about workarounds.</li>
		<li>Use of articulations may require an increase of 64K in the stack size for threads making API calls and engine worker threads</li>
	</ul>

		<li>Adjacency information option for TriangleMeshes.  This is controlled using the PxCookingParams::buildTriangleAdjacencies flag, and returned if available by PxMeshQuery::getTriangle().</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Broad Phase</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The sdk gracefully handles the case of more than 65536 broadphase pairs and reports a warning that some contacts will be dropped in the event that this limit is exceeded.  This affects all platforms except win32/win64/linux/linux64, which support a maximum number of 4294967296 pairs.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Collision Detection</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a memory corruption bug in heightfield code.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug in sphere vs mesh contact generation that could result in bad normals.</li>
		<li>Added a flag to enable or disable contact caching, to permit users to make a performance vs memory tradeoff.</li>
		<li>Fixed a crash bug in ContactReport cleanup code.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The simultaneous raising of both the PxShapeFlag::eSIMULATION_SHAPE and PxShapeFlag::eTRIGGER_SHAPE flags is now explicitly forbidden by the sdk.  If any of the two is raised then any attempt to raise the other is rejected by the sdk and an error is passed to the error stream. </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Articulations</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The API stubbed in 3.2.0 for applying an impulse to an entire articulation is now implemented.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>GPU Physics</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Much more specific error messages for CUDA compute capability related failures.</li>
		<li>Added SM35 support for GK110 GPUs.</li>
		<li>The CUDA contexts provided by the gpu dispatcher can now be shared across scenes.</li>
		<li>Fixed a possible out of bounds array access in GPU particle collision code.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Scene Queries</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Resolved poor GJK sweep convergence.</li>
		<li>Batched queries accept sphere geometry for sweeps.</li>
		<li>Optimized performance of raycasts.</li>
		<li>An internal limit of 65536 objects in the scene-query subsytem has been lifted.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where raycasts that sliced through two adjoining heightfields did not return correct results.</li>
		<li>Fixed a crash bug in PxFindOverlapTriangleMeshUtil when doing a sphere overlap query against a heightfield.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Cloth</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PxCloth::setMotionConstraints() now works with NULL parameter.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Character Controller</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PhysX CCT code no longer sets PxShape::userData.  </li>
		<li>Intersection of pairs of CCTs now uses the supplied filter data and the supplied callback prefilter.  The callback postfilter is not yet hooked up.</li>
		<li>A bug has been fixed whereby the filterData was ignored in one of the scene queries initiated by the PhysX CCT code.</li>
		<li>Introduced a more automatic mechanism for invelidating the character controller's scene cache.  As part of this, PxController::reportSceneChanged() was replaced with PxController::invalidateCache().</li>
		<li>Added helper functions PxController::get/setFootPosition() to let user specify the bottom point of the character controller, rather than the center.</li>
		<li>A new helper function, PxController::resize(), has been added to facilitate character controller resizing.</li>
		<li>PxControllerBehaviorFlag::eCCT_CAN_RIDE_ON_OBJECT is not the default behavior anymore.</li>
		<li>The slope limit is only observed when walking on static convex meshes, static triangle meshes, static boxes and static heightfields.  The slope limit is not observed when walking on dynamic or kinematic rigid bodies or static capsules or static spheres.  This partially fixes a bug where the slope limit was inadvertently considered for shapes attached to dynamic rigid bodies and inadvertently ignored for boxes attached to static shapes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The vehicle sdk now reports an error to the error stream and exits from PxVehicleUpates if PxInitVehicleSdk has not been called in advance.  This avoids a divide-by-zero error that can arise if the vehicle sdk has not been initialised correctly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Visual Debugger</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Releasing of cloth fabrics is reported to the VRD.</li>
		<li>Ext::Joint::setActors() call now reported to PVD.</li>
		<li>Fixed crash bug when removing an aggregate containing a PxArticulation, while PVD is running.</li>
	</ul>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added migration guide page from 3.1 to 3.2 to user's guide.</li>
		<li>Three new sample applications:  SampleCharacterCloth (character with cloth cape and cloth flags), SampleBridges (character controller walking on dynamic bridges and moving platforms), SampleCustomGravity (character controller with arbitrary up vector).</li>
		<li>On Windows, the PxFoundation instance is now a process wide singleton and part of the new PhysX3Common.dll library</li>
		<li>PxCreatePhysics() does not create a PxFoundation instance any longer. The PxFoundation instance has to be created in advance through PxCreateFoundation().</li>
		<li>Calls to PxCreatePhysics() are not valid anymore if a PxPhysics instance already exists.</li>
		<li>If profiling information should be sent to the PhysX Visual Debugger, a PxProfileZoneManager instance has to be provided when creating the PxPhysics instance.</li>
		<li>The version number constant PX_PUBLIC_FOUNDATION_VERSION has been replaced with PX_PHYSICS_VERSION. Both PxFoundation and PxPhysics use the same version number now.</li>
		<li>The API now distinguishes between input and output stream types.</li>
		<li>Added mechanism to reduce code size by not linking optional components.  See PxCreateBasePhysics() and the PxRegister*() functions.</li>
		<li>Added getConcreteTypeName() to API classes to provide run time type information.</li>
		<li>Added PxScene::getTimestamp() to retrieve the simulation counter.</li>
		<li>PxGetFoundation has been moved to PxGetFoundation.h</li>
		<li>The signature of PxCreatePhysics has changed:  The Foundation SDK instance must be passed in explicitly.  One can also hook profiling information by passing a PxProfileZoneManager.</li>
		<li>contact data block allocation now provides statistics on usage and max usage</li>
		<li>On all platforms except PS3, contact data blocks can be progressively allocated</li>

		<li>On Windows, CudaContextManagerDesc support appGUID now. It only works on release build. If your application employs PhysX modules that use CUDA you need to use a GUID so that patches for new architectures can be released for your game.You can obtain a GUID for your application from Nvidia.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduced a new contact generation mode, see eENABLE_PCM.  Note that this is an experimental feature that still shows simulation artifacts in some scenarios.</li>
		<li>Introduced two new friction simulation modes, see eENABLE_ONE_DIRECTIONAL_FRICTION and eENABLE_TWO_DIRECTIONAL_FRICTION.</li>

		<li>The contact report API has changed (for details see the documentation on PxSimulationEventCallback::onContact()). Among the changes are:
		<ul>
			<li>Reports only get sent for shape pairs which request them. Previously, reports were sent for an actor pair even if the requested shape pair event was not triggered (for example because other shapes of the same actors started colliding etc.)</li>
			<li>The following PxPairFlags have been removed eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FORCES, eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FORCE_PER_POINT, eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FEATURE_INDICES_PER_POINT. Forces and feature indices are now always provided if applicable.</li>
			<li>It is much easier now to skip shape pairs or contact point information when traversing the contact report data.</li>
			<li>The memory footprint of contact reports has been reduced.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The members featureIndex0/1 of PxContactPoint have been renamed to internalFaceIndex0/1 for consistency.</li>
		<li>For trigger reports, the eNOTIFY_TOUCH_PERSISTS event has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release. For performance and flexibility reasons it is recommended to use eNOTIFY_TOUCH_FOUND and eNOTIFY_TOUCH_LOST only and manage the persistent state separately.</li>

		<li>Some methods of PxAggregate have been renamed for consistency or replaced for extended functionality.
		<ul>
			<li>getMaxSize() is now called getMaxNbActors().</li>
			<li>getCurrentSize() is now called getNbActors().</li>

See SampleVehicle_SceneQuery.h for their implementation in SampleVehicle.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4WSimpleSetup and PxCreateVehicle4WSimulationData have been removed and replaced with default values in vehicle components, see PxVehicleComponents.h.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4WTelemetryData has been replaced with PxVehicleTelemetryData, a class that supports vehicles with any number of wheels, see PxVehicleTelemetryData</li>

		<li>Added helper functions to quickly configure 3-wheeled cars, see PxVehicle4WEnable3WTadpoleMode, PxVehicle4WEnable3WDeltaMode.</li>
	</ul>

    <h4>Serialization</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the functions PxPhysics::releaseUserReferences(), releaseCollection(), addCollection() and releaseCollected() to now take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
		<li>Platform conversion for serialized data has been moved from the ConvX command line tool to the PxBinaryConverter interface in the cooking library.</li>
		<li>Changed some functions in RepXUtility.h and RepX.h to take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
    </ul>


	<h4>What we removed:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Deformables have been removed. Use the optimized solution for clothing simulation instead (see documentation on PxCloth for details).</li>
		<li>PxSweepCache is deprecated.</li>
		<li>PVD is no longer enabled in the release build.</li>
		<li>Removed anisotropic friction.</li>
		<li>Removed the CCD mode eSWEPT_CONTACT_PAIRS.</li>
		<li>PxActorDesc has been removed.</li>
		<li>The ConvX tool has been removed.</li>
		<li>Removed empty default implementations of functions in PxSimulationEventCallback for consistency and because it can create bugs in user code if function prototypes change between releases.  Users must now supply (eventually blank) implementations for all functions.</li>
		<li>Octree and quadtree pruning structures have been removed.</li>
		<li>PxScene.overlapAny has been removed. overlapMultiple with maxNumHits 1 does the same.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Fixed Bugs</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PxScene::getActors() might not work properly when the startIndex parameter is used.</li>
		<li>Improved the doc-comment of PxConvexMesh::getMassInformation().</li>
        <li>RepX instantiation can lose all internal references when addOriginalIdsToObjectMap is false.</li>
        <li>PxSetGroup crashed when used on a compound.</li>
        <li>PhysXCommon.dll can be delay loaded.</li>
        <li>ContactReportStream can now handle huge report numbers and size (resize-able flag) can be set in PxSceneDesc.h.</li>
        <li>Fixed assert in sweep tests.</li>
		<li>Concurrent read/write operations during a PxScene::fetchResults() call were not detected properly and no warning message got sent in checked builds. Forbidden write operations during callbacks triggered by PxScene::fetchResults() (contact/trigger reports etc.) were not covered either.</li>
        <li>Fixed crash bug that occurred during collision detection when more than 16K of contact data was generated.  Contacts that generate more than 16K of contact data are now fully supported.</li>
		<li>Fixed crash bug when PhysX Visual Debugger is connected and an object gets modified and then released while the simulation is running.</li>
	</ul>

<a name="knownissues320">Known Issues And Limitations</a></h2>

<blockquote>

	<h4>Binary Serialization</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Meta data generation for PxParticleFluid and PxParticleSystem serializables currently fails.</li>
		<li>For collections that contain jointed rigid bodies all corresponding joints need to be added as well, otherwise deserialization will fail.
	</ul>
	<h4>Rigid Body Simulation</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Capsules and spheres can struggle to come to rest on even perfectly flat surfaces. To ensure these objects come to rest, it is necessary to increase angular damping on rigid bodies made of these shapes. In addition, flagging the capsule/sphere's material with physx::PxMaterialFlag::eDISABLE_STRONG_FRICTION can help bring these shapes to rest.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Character Cloth Sample</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>An NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 2.0 or higher is required for GPU accelerated simulation in the SampleCharacterCloth sample, if no such device is present then simulation will be performed on the CPU.</li>
		<li>Note that this is not a general SDK requirement, the clothing SDK supports cards with Compute Capability < 2.0 but with limitations on mesh size.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Character Controller</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Releasing shapes of actors that are in touch with a character controller may lead to crashes. Releasing whole actors doesn't lead to the same problems. PxController::invalidateCache() can be used to work around these issues.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><br>Release Notes - NVIDIA PhysX SDK 3.0</h1>

<h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">February 14<sup>th</sup>2011</h2>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.0</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>

	This third major version of the SDK is a significant rewrite of the entire technology.  We did away with a large amount of legacy clutter and replaced them with a wealth of new features and improvements.
	Because even the API changes are so significant, it is easier to see it as a whole new product rather than a long list of changes.

	<h4>What we removed:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The dedicated NVIDIA PhysX PPU hardware is not supported any more.</li>
		<li>Scene compartments are not supported anymore. All created physical objects are now part of one and the same compartment.</li>
		<li>Force fields are not part of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK anymore.</li>
		<li>Splitting a simulation timestep into multiple substeps is not a functionality of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK any longer and has to be implemented above the SDK.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Key new features:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Articulations: A way to create very stiff joint assemblies.</li>
		<li>Serialization: Save objects in a binary format and load them back quickly!</li>
		<li>Broad Phase Clustering: Put objects that belong together into a single broadphase volume.</li>
		<li>Driverless Model: No need to worry about system software on PC anymore.</li>
		<li>Dynamic Character Controller: A character controller that can robustly walk on dynamic objects.</li>
		<li>Vehicle Library: A toolkit to make vehicles, including an all new tire model.</li>
		<li>Non-Simulation Objects: A staging are outside of the simulation from where you can add things into the simulation at high speed.</li>
		<li>Simulation Task Manager: Take control of the management of simulation tasks.</li>
		<li>Stable Depenetration: Large penetrations can be gracefully recovered from.</li>
		<li>Double Buffering: You can read from and write to the simulated objects while the simulation is running on another thread.</li>
		<li>Mesh Scaling: Create different nonuniformly scaled instances of your meshes and convexes without duplicating the memory.</li>
		<li>Distance Based Collision Detection: Have the simulation create contacts before objects touch, and do away with unsightly overlaps.</li>
		<li>Fast Continuous Collision Detection: Have small and high speed objects collide correctly without sacrificing performance.</li>
		<li>Significantly increased performance and memory footprint, especially on consoles.</li>
		<li>Unified solver for deformables and rigid bodies for great interaction.</li>
		<li>Triangle collision detection with deformables.</li>
		<li>Support for our new Physics Visual Debugger, including integrated profiling.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Math classes</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Matrix based transforms have been replaced by quaternions.</li>
		<li>All angles are now expressed in radians. IN PARTICULAR the PxQuat constructor from
			axis and angle as well as the getAngleAxis and fromAngleAxis methods now use radians rather than degrees.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Capsules are now defined to extend along the x rather than the y axis.</li>
		<li>Triangle meshes do not support heightfield functionality anymore. Use the dedicated PxHeightField class instead.</li>
		<li>Dynamic triangle mesh actors are not supported any longer. However, you can decompose your mesh into convex parts and create a dynamic actor consisting of these convex parts.</li>
		<li>The deprecated heightfield property NxHeightFieldDesc::verticalExtent is not supported any longer. Please use the PxHeightFieldDesc::thickness parameter instead.</li>
		<li>NxSpringAndDamperEffector is not supported anymore. Use PxDistanceJoint instead.</li>
		<li>Joints are now part of the PhysX extensions library (PhysXExtensions).</li>
		<li>Wheel shapes have been replaced by the more flexible entity PxWheel. A default wheel implementation, encapsulating most of the old wheel functionality, can be found in the PhysX extensions library (see PxDefaultWheel).</li>
		<li>The NxUtilLib library has been removed. Sweep/overlap/raycast tests and other helper methods can be found in the new GeomUtils library.</li>
		<li>Materials can no longer be accessed through indices. Per triangle material meshes need a material table which can be specified per shape (see PxShape::setMaterials() for details).</li>
		<li>The default material is not available anymore.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particle Systems, Particle Fluids</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The NxFluid class has been replaced with two classes for separation of functionality and ease of use.
			<ul>
				<li>PxParticleSystem: Particles colliding against the scene.</li>
				<li>PxParticleFluid: Particles simulating a fluid (sph).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Simplified parameterization for particle systems.
			<ul>
				<li>Using absolute distances instead of relative multipliers to rest spacing</li>
				<li>Simplified sph parameters</li>
				<li>Unified collision parameters with deformable and rigid body features</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Creating and releasing particles is now fully controlled by the application.
			<ul>
				<li>Particle lifetime management isn't provided through the SDK anymore.</li>
				<li>Emitters have been removed from the SDK.</li>
				<li>Drain shapes don't cause particles to be deleted directly, but to be flagged instead.</li>
				<li>Initial particle creation from the particle system descriptor isn't supported anymore.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Particle data buffer handling has been moved to the SDK.</li>
		<li>Per particle collision rest offset.</li>
		<li>GPU accelerated particle systems.
			<ul>
				<li>Application controllable mesh mirroring to device memory.</li>
				<li>Runtime switching between software and GPU accelerated implementation.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
