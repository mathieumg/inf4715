Such altered versions also must not be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names “Info-ZIP” (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different capitalizations), “Pocket UnZip,” “WiZ” or “MacZip” without the explicit permission of Info-ZIP. Such altered versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP will provide support for the altered versions. 4) Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names “Info-ZIP,” “Zip,” “UnZip,” “UnZipSFX,” “WiZ,” “Pocket UnZip,” “Pocket Zip,” and “MacZip” for its own source and binary releases.
