* Can OLEMethod class be changed to COMMethod and take an IDispatch* instead of OLEObject* in the constructor. Then it can be used in other places.

* Is there's anyway for maxscript plugins to define def generic's and for classes not derived from MS_LOCAL_ROOT_CLASS, for example I have two classes deriving from Rollout and Value and both need to support def generics. If MS_LOCAL_ROOT_CLASS is derived from Rollout then I can't support generic in the other class derived from Value.

* RolloutControl should implement a virtual function called OnClose() which get's called when ever the rollout is closed, this will help in freeing resources allocated by controls

MaxScript
Support control creation directly in Rollout Floater instead of always declaring rollouts. Simon already has this working in one of his extensions.

issues:

latest fixes:
* fixed string handling for property set's and method call arguments, now you
  can safely do 
    ax.Navigate "beta.discreet.com" 
  where: ax is the Microsoft Web Browser Control

* added .size property for all types of activeX controls

* added a new write only property .height to rollup pages, now you can now do
  <rollout>.height = 100

* added support for color properties, the internal representation of colors for
  activeX controls is COLORREF(unsigned integer) so you'll always get them in
  integer's but you can set them like

  ax.forecolor = red -- if a .forecolor property exists

* also added restricted functions like QueryInterface, AddRef, Release being
  displayed by showMethods() function

DiscreetBeta.ms
----------------
Added a DiscreetBeta.ms file to stdplugs\stdscripts directory. This is a macro script file that lets you invoke the Discreet Beta Forum directly from Max. You also display it in a viewport.

You can assign the script to a menu/quad menu/keyboard shortcut/tool button by picking it up from the "Main UI > Web_Tools > Discreet_Web_Board" from the respective customization dialogs. 

The MacroScript launches the webboard in a rollout floater from where you can login. You can display it in a viewport by picking "Views > Extended > beta.discreet.com" from the viewport right-click menu.

 
* fixed the make file to register the container properly, previously it used to
  throw an error as it could not find core.dll in the path(thanks to Larry for
  a tip)

* since we install atl.dll with Magma I changed the release configuration to
  "Min Size" instead of "Min Dependency". This reduces mxsactive.dlx drastically

Rollout Floaters as Extended viewports
--------------------------------------

You can use the following functions to register/unregister rollout floaters as extended viewports
  
  registerViewWindow <rollout_floater>
    registers any rollout floater as an extended viewport. The title of the
    floater appears in the viewport right click menu, under Views > Extended
    menu. When picked the floater will be displayed in that viewport. 
	
   If click anywhere on the outside floater border, it will pop up the standard
   views menu. This will let you switch to a different view window.

  unRegisterViewWindow <rollout_floater>
    unregisters a floater as an extended view window. It will throw an error if      
    the floater is currently displayed in a viewport.
