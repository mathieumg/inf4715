// A generalization of a mouse procedure for face creation. This class
// implements the template design pattern described by Gamma et al. in "Design
// Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". Hence this class
// provides a general implementation of MouseCallBack::proc. proc is
// implemented in terms of the template operations. This class also receives
// EventRouter::Notify messages that trigger the Backspace function.

	// HitTestVertex() returns true. The first node returned by HitTestVertex()
	// is set as the primary node. As the user moves the mouse around, the
